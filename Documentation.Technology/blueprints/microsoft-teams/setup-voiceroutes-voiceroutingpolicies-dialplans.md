# 2. Setup Voice Routes, Voice routing policies and Dial Plans

Every country in the world has their own set of rules for how telephone numbers can be dialed. Therefore, the voice routes, voice routing policies and dial plans will be setup with a script that has been automatically generated by our friend Ken Lasko over at [UCDialPlans](https://www.ucdialplans.com/). This allows for ease of rule generation for over 232 supported countries in the world. We'll be using the tool to generate VRP, VR and DP's for UK, London.

## Download the UC Dial Plan script

1. Browse [UCDialPlans](https://www.ucdialplans.com/)
2. Sign in with your Microsoft ID

## Execute script for your MS Teams tenant

1. Logon to MS Teams through Powershell
    - `Connect-MicrosoftTeams`
2. Browse to the directory that the script resides and execute it:
