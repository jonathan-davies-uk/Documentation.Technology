# Blueprints

These blueprints you are about to see, have been certified and trusted to work in accordance to impecible technology standards. You can use these standards as a trusted source of rolling out the relevant technology you would like to harness.

Blueprints enable engineers or architects to map out a project design/plan. This allows for the rapid deployment of said subjects within new, or existing envirnoments.
