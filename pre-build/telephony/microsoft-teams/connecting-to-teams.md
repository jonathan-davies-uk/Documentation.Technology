# Connecting to Teams

Teams can be asked in a number of ways, the two most common are through the Teams Admin Center (TAC) and Powershell.

## Powershell

To connect to Teams via Powershell, do the following.

1. Run Powershell as administrator (this only needs to be done once - just to install the module)
```
Install-Module MicrosoftTeams
Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
Connect-MicrosoftTeams
```

## Teams Admin Center

1. Browse to [Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com)
2. Alternatively you can browse to it through the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com)
